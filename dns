DNS and Resolvers Explained

explain  about the dns and resolvers


Sure! Let's break down DNS and resolvers in simple terms:
What is DNS?

DNS stands for Domain Name System. It's like the phone book of the internet. When you type a web address (like www.google.com) into your browser, DNS translates that address into an IP address (like 172.217.3.110), which is the actual address of the server where the website is hosted.
How Does DNS Work?

    You Enter a Website URL: When you type a URL into your browser, it starts a process to find the IP address associated with that URL.

    Query the DNS Resolver: The first step is to ask the DNS resolver. This resolver is typically provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or can be a public resolver like Google's (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare's (1.1.1.1).

    Check Cache: The resolver checks its cache to see if it already knows the IP address. If it does, it returns the IP address to your browser, and you're done!

    Ask the Root Server: If the IP address is not in the cache, the resolver asks one of the root servers. Root servers are like the main directories of the internet.

    Ask the TLD Server: The root server doesn't know the exact IP address, but it knows where to find the Top-Level Domain (TLD) server (like .com, .org, .net). The resolver is then directed to the TLD server for the domain.

    Ask the Authoritative DNS Server: The TLD server tells the resolver where to find the authoritative DNS server for the specific domain (like google.com). This server has the actual IP address of the website.

    Get the IP Address: The resolver asks the authoritative DNS server for the IP address of the website. Once it gets this information, it returns the IP address to your browser.

    Access the Website: Your browser can now use this IP address to connect to the website's server and display the website.

What are Resolvers?

Resolvers are like the intermediaries that handle the communication between your browser and the DNS servers. Here are the main types:

    Recursive Resolver: This is the most common type of resolver. It does all the work of querying different DNS servers to find the IP address. It handles each step from asking the root server to the authoritative server.

    Caching Resolver: This resolver stores previously obtained IP addresses for a certain period. If you request an address it has recently looked up, it can quickly provide the IP address without having to go through the entire process again.

Example of DNS Resolution Process

Let's say you want to visit www.example.com:

    Enter URL: You type www.example.com in your browser.
    Query Resolver: Your browser asks the DNS resolver for www.example.com.
    Check Cache: The resolver checks its cache. If not found, it proceeds.
    Root Server: The resolver asks a root server for www.example.com.
    TLD Server: The root server directs the resolver to the .com TLD server.
    Authoritative Server: The TLD server directs the resolver to the authoritative server for example.com.
    IP Address: The authoritative server gives the resolver the IP address (e.g., 93.184.216.34).
    Return IP: The resolver returns this IP address to your browser.
    Connect: Your browser connects to the IP address and loads the website.

Why is DNS Important?

    Human-Friendly: We remember names like www.google.com much easier than 172.217.3.110.
    Efficiency: DNS allows for efficient routing and load balancing across the internet.
    Security: While not inherently secure, DNS can be made more secure with protocols like DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions).

Summary

DNS is the system that translates easy-to-remember domain names into IP addresses that computers use. Resolvers are the tools that help perform this translation, either by doing the full lookup process (recursive resolvers) or by quickly retrieving cached results (caching resolvers). This system is essential for navigating the internet efficiently and effectively.
what is a resolver in simple 


Sure, let's simplify it even more:
What is a Resolver?

A resolver is like a helper or a translator that finds the correct IP address for the website you want to visit.
How Does It Work?

    You Type a Web Address: Imagine you type "www.example.com" into your web browser.

    Asks the Resolver: Your computer asks the resolver, "What is the IP address for www.example.com?"

    Checks Its Memory (Cache): The resolver first checks if it already knows the answer from a recent lookup. If it does, it tells your computer the IP address right away.

    Finds the IP Address: If the resolver doesn't know the answer, it goes on a little journey:
        Asks the Root Server: It starts by asking a main directory (root server).
        Asks the Next Server: It then follows the directions to another server that knows more about ".com" websites.
        Asks the Final Server: Finally, it asks the server that knows all about "example.com."

    Gets the IP Address: This final server gives the resolver the correct IP address for "www.example.com."

    Tells Your Computer: The resolver then tells your computer the IP address, and your computer can now go to that address and load the website.

Simple Summary

A resolver is a tool that helps find the numerical address (IP address) for the website name you enter, so your computer can connect to the right place on the internet.
explain resolvers with a real time example how does it work like that


Sure! Let's use a real-time example to explain how resolvers work:
Real-Time Example: Visiting www.example.com
Step-by-Step Process:

    Entering the URL:
        You open your web browser and type in "www.example.com" in the address bar, then hit Enter.

    Browser Asks the Resolver:
        Your computer doesn't know the IP address for "www.example.com", so it asks the resolver provided by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) or a public DNS resolver like Google (8.8.8.8).

    Checking the Cache:
        The resolver first checks its cache (a temporary storage) to see if it has recently looked up "www.example.com". If it finds the IP address in the cache, it skips the rest of the steps and quickly returns the IP address to your browser.

    Resolver Journey Begins:
        If the IP address is not in the cache, the resolver starts its journey to find it. Hereâ€™s what happens next:

    a. Root Server Query:
        The resolver asks one of the root servers, "Do you know the IP address for www.example.com?"
        The root server doesn't know the exact IP address, but it tells the resolver, "I don't know the IP address, but ask the .com TLD server."

    b. TLD Server Query:
        The resolver then asks the .com TLD (Top-Level Domain) server, "Do you know the IP address for www.example.com?"
        The .com TLD server replies, "I don't know the exact IP address, but you should ask the authoritative DNS server for example.com."

    c. Authoritative DNS Server Query:
        Finally, the resolver asks the authoritative DNS server for "example.com", "Do you know the IP address for www.example.com?"
        The authoritative DNS server responds, "Yes, the IP address for www.example.com is 93.184.216.34."

    Returning the IP Address:
        The resolver now has the IP address (93.184.216.34) and returns this information to your browser.

    Browser Connects to the Website:
        Your browser uses the IP address to connect to the server at 93.184.216.34 and loads the website www.example.com.

Recap with Real-World Analogy:

    You: Imagine you're trying to call a friend named "Example" but you don't have their phone number.
    Resolver: Your resolver is like a helpful operator who can find the number for you.
    Cache Check: First, the operator checks if they recently looked up "Example's" number and remembers it.
    Root Server: If not, they start by asking a main directory (root server) where to find numbers for people with the last name ".com".
    TLD Server: The main directory directs the operator to another directory (TLD server) that specializes in ".com" names.
    Authoritative Server: This directory tells the operator to ask "Example's" personal assistant (authoritative server).
    Getting the Number: The assistant knows "Example's" number and tells the operator.
    Connecting the Call: The operator then tells you "Example's" number, and you can call your friend.

This whole process happens very quickly, often in milliseconds, making it seem instantaneous to users.
who owns dns 


DNS (Domain Name System) is a decentralized and distributed system, meaning no single entity owns the entire DNS. Instead, it is managed by a combination of organizations and stakeholders around the world. Here are some of the key players involved in managing and operating the DNS:
1. ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)

    Role: ICANN is responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.
    Function: ICANN oversees the allocation and assignment of domain names, IP addresses, and other internet resources.

2. IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)

    Role: IANA is a department within ICANN.
    Function: IANA manages the root DNS zone, which is the top-level DNS zone in the hierarchical DNS system. It coordinates the global pool of IP addresses and DNS root zone management.

3. Domain Name Registries

    Role: These are organizations that manage the registration of domain names within specific top-level domains (TLDs) like .com, .org, .net, and country-specific TLDs like .uk or .jp.
    Function: They ensure that each domain name within their TLD is unique and maintains the database of these domain names.

4. Domain Name Registrars

    Role: Registrars are companies accredited by ICANN and other registries to sell domain names to the public.
    Function: They provide the interface for users to register domain names and often provide additional services like web hosting, email hosting, and domain management.

5. Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

    Role: ISPs often operate their own DNS resolvers.
    Function: They provide DNS resolution services to their customers, translating domain names into IP addresses.

6. DNS Root Server Operators

    Role: There are 13 root server operators, each operating one or more of the DNS root servers.
    Function: These operators ensure the root servers are functioning correctly, which is critical for the DNS system to work properly.

7. End Users and Organizations

    Role: Individuals and organizations register and use domain names.
    Function: They own and manage specific domain names and can configure their DNS settings (e.g., to point their domain to a specific web server).

Decentralized Nature:

The DNS is fundamentally decentralized, meaning that no single entity has complete control over the entire system. Instead, it operates through a hierarchical structure with coordination among various entities at different levels of the hierarchy.
How They Work Together:

    ICANN/IANA: ICANN coordinates with IANA to manage the DNS root zone.
    Registries and Registrars: Registries manage TLDs, and registrars help end-users register domain names within those TLDs.
    Root Servers: Root server operators ensure the root DNS servers are always operational.
    Resolvers and ISPs: ISPs and public DNS services operate resolvers that help end-users translate domain names into IP addresses.

This multi-stakeholder approach ensures the stability, security, and scalability of the DNS, allowing the internet to function smoothly.
