There are different os like windows mac linux .when u want to use a other os without actually deleting the present os
and parallely we can use the other required operating system inside the operating system using the main computers 
hardware resources and they share the hardware at the time of simultaneous usage of the operating systems.
vm:virtual meachine simply refered as a machine that is present inside in the computer to run on the other os with 
the help of the hard ware that is shared.....
