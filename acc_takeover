ACCOUNT TAKE OVER BUG:

1.RESPONSE MANIPULATION:
           1.create a normal user account and try to login and do intercept and copy the response
           2.now simply enter the victim email with wrong password to login
           3.now do intercept and analyze the response that says wrong password
           4.replace it with the response of the first login....
            -->if its vullnerable u can acess victim account if not u may get the acess to the hackeraccount only because of any kinds of tokens etc...
 2.STATUS CODE MAINUPLATION:
           1. in some instances u can only see some few details in the sucess and failed response if so 
           2.u can try to manipulate the status code 
           3.if the login panel has a password reset feature u can abuse it simply by status manipulation if possible
