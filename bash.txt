bash scripts allow to exwcute the commands form the file.
bash is mostly used for automating scripts.

!.sh is used to identify the script as bash script

2.every script should start as #!/bin/bash/

because every time the command will be executed after being intrepted by the bash which is located in bin

for commenting purpose we use #


 VARIABLES:

  variables are like storage containers which store the values

   2 types of variables:

    1> system defined
    2> user defined 

    SYSTEM DEFINED VARIABLE : are those varibles its created defined and maintained by os

    USER DEFINED VARIABLE: are those variables created and defined by user.

    to use the variables in our program we must use $ before the variable name.



    eg:
    #!/bin/bash
    #system defined variable 
    echo $BASH  #bash is system defined variable
    echo $pwd

    #userdefined variables

    name ="kushal"
    echo $name


    READ USER INPUT:

    #!/bin/bash
    #read user input
    echo"enter your name"
    echo"enter age"
    read name
    read age
    echo "entered name :$name"
    echo "entered name :$age"

    ARGUMENTS:

    #!/bin/bash
    #print total arguments and their values

    echo "total arguments:" $#  --total arguments count can be known
    echo "total arguments:" $@  --argument values stored in $@

    ###command line arguments can be acessed as 
    echo "first->" $1
    echo "first->" $2

    to run this file for example file name example.sh

    chmod 777 example.sh

    ./example.sh kushal 52

    -- 2 cmd line arguments are passed they are kushal and 52

   IF ELSE :

   SYNTAX: if [ condition ]
           then
           echo"condition true"
           else
           echo "condition failed"
           fi

    *fi means ending

    simple bash script:
    #!/bin/bash
    echo"enter a value"
    read a
    echo"enter b value"
    read b

    if [ $a == $b]   
    then 
    echo" a is equal to b"
    else
    echo" a in not equal to b"
    fi

how to find the greater than or equal number

if[ $a -eq $b ]

FILE OPERATORS IN BASH:

-f file exit
-d dir exit or not
-s file not empty
-d dir is directory exists not a file
(to check the permission of a file)
-w file is writable file
-r file is read only file
-x file is file executable.

simple bash code

#!/bin/bash
echo"enter file name"
read file
if [ -f $ file ]  or -d (directory exists or not) 
then
echo "$file found"
else
echo "$file not found"
fi

AND,OR OPERATORS:

when we have 2 conditions, when the both conditions are true then we obtain true here we use and operator (&) or -a
when any one of the condition is true we obtain output true (||) or -o

#!/bin/bash
echo "enter ssc perc"
read ssc
echo"enter inter marks"
read inter
if [ $ssc -ge 90 -a $inter -ge 85 ]
then
echo "eligible candidate"
else
echo" not eligible"
fi

ARTHEMATIC OPERATIONS:
+ operator 
- operator
* operator 
/ operator 

#!/bin/bash
echo "enter number"
read num1
echo "enter number"
read num2
echo " addition : " $((num1+num2)) -use respective symbol u want

echo "scale=2;$num1/num2" | bc

--scale decides the number of digits after the decimal point

--without | bc we dont get floating point output

ELSE IF:
multiple conditions evaluation
syntax:
 elif [ condition ]
 then
    echo " output"

LOOPS:
for loop :

syntax :

#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..10..2}; do
echo "number $i"
done
( or )
#!/bin/bash
for ((i=0; i<10 ;i++) ;do
echo "number $i"
done

when we want to check the size of the file then 

 du -h filename.txt
